# All about the analysis

*Saturday, 12 March 2016, 3:30 p.m.*

We talk about interrogating the data, but exactly what does that mean? What questions should be we asking? How do we formulate those questions? What about running various analysis techniques that might surface "interesting" outliers in data? Or is the answer always "Apply the random forest classification technique"? Our panel of experienced data journalists will explore the intricacies of data analysis.

## Narco Data

*Tania Montalvo*

Exploring organized crime in Mexico. Over 40 years, drug trafficking expanded. From 2 organized crime groups to 9. What is the real size of organized crime? Why are the cartels important and powerful in the rest of the world?

## Job Promise Explorer

*Tyler Dukes*

Lots of money going to companies expanding or relocating to the state. Do these companies actually hire who they say they're going to hire? Are they paid accordingly?

Parsed press releases for job announcements, found out how many were actually created.

Many companies hadn't hired a single worker.

Wasn't terribly complicated, but surfaced information few people saw.

## La Nacion Tipsheet

Data life cycle, from the moment it's obtained.

Congress published information about money in 40,000 password-protected PDFs. Downloaded, removed password, OCRed, put into Excel. Journalists worked with the Excel doc, not the PDFs.

## What are the typical analysis techniques?

*Tyler Dukes*: Depends what you're looking at. Get a sense of what this is telling me. Find outliers. Narrow the focus. "What's normal in this dataset?"

*Tania Montalvo*: "The data is always talking." There are urban myths out there, ask the data what's true.

*Tyler Dukes*: Either driven by exploration of a dataset, or driven by a central question. Figure out how big a bite you want to take out of the data. How do I make those make the most sense.

## What's the utility for journalists for data analysis/cleaning?

*Ricardo Brom*: Structured data opens a lot of possibilities. Forward compatibility, searchability.

## How do you prepare data?

*Ricardo Brom*: Uses Xmind mindmapper to map what's in the data and connect it to each other. Crowdsources documents.

## One good tip for interrogating data?

*Tyler Dukes*: "Don't be afraid to ask small questions."

*Tania Montalvo*: Teamwork is basic. We can make amazing stories working together because of a different but shared vision.

Go further than the data. Talk to experts.

*Ricardo Brom*: Keep track of where the data came from. Mashed up two data sets later on, but needed to remember that one set came from a whistleblower.

## Q&A

Q: Where are the job creation data Tyler used?

*Tyler Dukes*: Went to the law that created the job program, it said who was supposed to keep the data. Wound up doing an end run around commerce department by asking legislators to forward him the report they got from the commerce department.
