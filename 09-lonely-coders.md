# So you want to be a lonely coder

*Friday, 11 March 2016, 3:30 p.m.*

How do you transition from a journalist who does data stuff sometimes to a full-fledged coder in your newsroom and what happens when you do? This session will help you take your data skills to the next level by giving you easy-to-replicate projects and newsroom tools that involve minimal coding and can be done in most locations and beats. Panelists will take you through some “easy wins” for your newsroom and discuss their experiences navigating newsrooms as the only coder in the room, as well as how to get buy-in from your boss and to convince higher-ups of the extra value in these types of projects.
