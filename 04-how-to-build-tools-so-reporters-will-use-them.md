How do you know they want the tool?

Talking with people you're working with, finding out what they need. Talk about it in meetings, message all reporters. Beta test with one or two people and get feedback.

Collecting tools together: Like lunchbox.

Superusers -- Middle ground -- people who would never use it

Building tools where people are — Twitter, Slack.

Campaign Finance

Building in features as they're asked for: Wait until something's asked for a bunch of times. Try to get out in front of it.

When do you go from making stuff by hand to building a tool for others to use?
Wait until people are doing something badly.

Stop everything from being a fire drill? Aka how do you prioritize?

Time is a currency.

Building own tools vs. using others' tools?

Where are you starting from? How far do you need to go.

How do you make sure that old stuff is still available later on?

Don't assume third-party stuff will be available later.

How do you let people know tools exist?

Wiki. Need something like propaganda for our tools.

Editors should mention tools that made successful projects possible.

Brown bags. ID a few key people who will evangelize for you.

Working with wide range of skill levels?

Involve reporters from day one. Sit down and have them list requirements. Physically go to them and talk to them about it. Try not to make them complicated.

Ready to publish checkbox, must be checked before you can publish. It wiggles.

It's an ongoing conversation.
