# Agate for data analysis in python

*Saturday, 12 March 2016, 9 a.m.*

In this hands-on session we'll introduce you to programmatic data analysis with the agate module for Python. We'll go through the basics—reading CSV files, transforming data, and running basic statistical analysis—while leaving plenty of room for your questions. This session is ideal for folks with some Python experience, especially those who've reached the limits of what they can do with tools like csvkit, but find pandas and numpy bewildering.
