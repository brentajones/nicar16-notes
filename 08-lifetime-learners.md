# How to keep up: Newsapps teams as lifetime learners

*Friday, 11 March 2016, 11:30 a.m.*

It’s the great newsroom double bind: keep up with new technologies or risk becoming obsolete,. but do it while keeping up your day job (which takes all your time). If everyone in the newsroom feels this pressure, the news apps developers and CAR reporters who thrive on being the cool kids on the bleeding edge can feel it even more keenly. In this session, we'll consider some of the methods we use as individuals and as teams to overcome this challenge and build an environment that fosters continuous learning. A few questions we'll consider: How do I continuously hone my chops and keep current with changing technology if that’s not the only thing I do with my time? What strategies have individuals and teams developed that build learning into their workflows and routines? How can editors help create a team culture that supports learning and experimentation without sacrificing productivity? And how can these lessons be applied more broadly to help less technically minded reporters catch up and keep up?

## A challenge of changing technology

*Adam Schweigart*

No background in news or tech. Learned everything he knows on the job/hobby.

Biggest problem is finding a balance that works. Always behind, which is hard. The confluence of news and technology is especially difficult. We're trying to solve hard problems.

How do we hold each other accountable for learning so the whole team can move forward?

*Mariana Santos*

No breaking news, so we have more time. Use of VR: They built their own. Excited about new tools, how can we use them the best? How can we do data visualization in addition to VR? It has to be useful, otherwise why use it? Look at new technologies and ask how can we apply this to journalism?

As a manager, I'm cheerleader of the team, what's your passion, what are you interested in pursuing?

*Gabriel Dance*

Internal pressures vs. External pressures

If you don't feel like you're struggling to keep up, you're probably not pushing hard enough.

Struggle can be useful because it's interspersed with successes.

"You're going to fail, all the time. And occasionally, hopefully, you'll succeed."

External pressures

Editors, elsewhere

Someone sees the latest cool thing and they just want to do it.

We must help educate. We take that on when we run teams. "Deflect and protect".

### Failure is an option

*Mariana Santos*

If editors want a technology, we think about how it can best apply. Plan A is wild success, Plan B is less ambitious and easy.

Evergreen projects provide flexibility

*Gabriel Dance*

Failure is an interesting word; There are different levels of failure.

Build different strengths within your team. Makes complete failure less of an option.

*Adam Schweigert*

Building different strengths helps with hiring too.

Where are we weakest?

Failure is fine as long as you learn from it.

Spending 5 minutes vs. 5 hours vs. 5 days exploring something.

*Gabriel Dance*

A nice way to create an evironment for success is to "not hire dickheads."

"You need to hire people who get along with one another."

"People are successful when they're happy."

*Troy Thibodeaux*

"Tech-tosterone"

### How does knowledge share happen?

*Mariana Santos*

Organize workshops for everyone. Invite editors and producers. Fusion does once a month.

*Gabriel Dance*

Brownbags. Everyone's busy, but take the time.

If your team is congenial, some of this happens organically.

A lot of it just involves speaking to one another, which sounds obvious but a lot of teams don't do it. Foster an environment of communication.

*Adam Schweigert*

Places where everyone goes home at 5, eats lunch alone are kind of depressing.

Remote teams have to work extra hard.

Office hours, community call, project feedback, multi-organization Slacks.

Treat the team and process almost like its own product.

### How do you keep up and now what's coming next?

*Mariana Santos*

Think about your audience and where they are already.

*Gabriel Dance*

Keep an eye on the people you admire. Have heroes.

Be tapped into the pop culture. Figure out what they're into, and *why* they're into it. Pivot into one of your own projects.

*Adam Schweigert*

Watch artists and comedians. They're doing this too. Look outside of news.

*Gabriel Dance*

Also advertising. Advertisers' jobs are to get your attention and convince you to do something. That is also our job.

### How to hone existing skills?

*Gabriel Dance*

The best journalists I know are the hardest working journalists I know.

If you're doing what you love, you'll do it all the time. It's not work.

Iterate. Every time we do a project, there needs to be a gain that the next project or site can benefit from.

*Adam Schweigert*

A lot of our work is based on how it can apply to the most organizations.

One-off projects can have value. Creativity, boundary-pushing.

### How do you get/give feedback?

*Mariana Santos*

Point out where we did badly and can do better next time.

*Gabriel Dance*

Must be honest. There's always room for improvement. Debriefs and reviews.

*Adam Schweigert*

Share your work. Write about it. Get it out of your head.

*Gabriel Dance*

Documentation! Organizations change, people leave. Institutional Knowledge is very important.

### Q&A

Q: What are some good conferences that are off the beaten path?

A: *Mariana Santos*: Ads conferences. Art conferences.

*Adam Schweigert*: Lectures and meetups can also be useful.

*Gabriel Dance*: Conference cynic. But have a hobby. Will expand your mind into other opportunities. Journalism can be an echo chamber.

Q: How do you build community on a team, make an open environment?

A: *Gabriel Dance*: Hire the right people. Always be candid, say what you mean. That's not being mean. Talk about your personal failures.

*Adam Schweigert*: Have standards, a code of conduct. Institutionalize it as part of the team's values.

Q: How do you balance team friendship with diversifying newsroom?

A: *Mariana Santos*: Easier said than done. There are still disagreements among friends. Can be harder when you're good friends with everyone. What is best for the company? Be kind. Say hello in the morning.

*Gabriel Dance*: We're fallible. Trying to hire people exclusively for skills doesn't necessarily make good teams. Diversity is important. Different people see the world in a different way. It's not impossible to find nice people who are diverse who have good skills, but it is harder. We undervalue diversity and overvalue skills.
