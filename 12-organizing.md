# Conversations: Getting organized - Letting information work for you, rather than being buried by it

*Saturday, 12 March 2016, 10:15 a.m.*

We’ll discuss how best to organize all the information we need to do our jobs: Bookmarking, file organization, email, paper; how do you make information work for you rather than being buried by it? We’ll try to stay focused on ideas and processes, rather than specific tools so we can maximize the utility for folks, no matter what tools they have access to at their workplaces.
